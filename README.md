## Abstract

A numerical solution to the time-independent Schr ̈odinger equation in one dimension is found using Numerov’s method. The use case of simple harmonic motion is used to test the results of the numerical solutions against the easy to find analytical solutions. The results showed that the solution this method produces has no significant variation from the analytical solution for small values of x. It is theorised that the reason for huge inaccuracies at larger values of x is due to the use of a Taylor expansion to find the second value of ψ, expanded around x = 0. It is also shown that the further the energy eigenvalue from the exact value the larger the error, and hence a method of find the exact value from a close guess is formulated.
